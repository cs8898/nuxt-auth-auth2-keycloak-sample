# NuxtAuth Oauth2 Keycloak Sample

This is a small Sample to show a "convenient" solution for the problems mentioned in
[nuxt-community/auth-module#559](https://github.com/nuxt-community/auth-module/issues/559).  

The Problem is the usage of "wrong parameters" as described in the discussion.

I also created a different fork that tackles some more issues, like the "responsibility" when to add the credential.
